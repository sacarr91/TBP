                    <h4>Decide on a strategy for teaching technique</h4>
                    <p>While there's a substantial amount of "on the fly" that goes with surviving your first year in a
                        new content
                        area (you know, for things you couldn't anticipate), do your best to prioritize the thing that
                        really matters:
                        teaching. Foundation and technique, if nothing else, are crucial for future success.

                    <h4>Teach to your students</h4>
                    <p>Checking your pacing against provided curriculum or other programs helps us get a "status check"
                        for where
                        we are, but don't skip important basics to try to keep up with the Joneses. Have patience and
                        trust your
                        wisdom to teach YOUR students the quality material that helps them succeed long term.

                    <h4>Communicate!!!</h4>
                    <p>It's easy to let communication fall to the wayside when you're overwhelmed with everything you have to do, 
                        but when you keep in touch and keep an open line of communication, the parents are willing to help out and
                        work with you--making your job much more manageable.

                    <h4>Learn what you can DIY (and what you can't)</h4>
                    <p>Learn some small repairs to save your program some cash by attending choice conference sessions or by watching some of
                        the videos in the gallery below. If a repair is beyond your ability, don't hesitate to send it to a shop. Pro tip: Wood
                        glue is NOT your friend!!!!!!!

                    <h4>Keep track of your inventory</h4>
                    <p>You'll likely have an inventory audit to some extent once or twice a year, where you'll be held responsible for showing 
                        everything is where it should be. Plus, keeping up with inventory helps a ton to ensure your instruments don't grow legs.
                        Have a method of keeping track, whether through your own spreadsheet creation (Google Sheets, Excel) or a third-party database (Charms, CutTime)
                    </p>

                    <h4>Organize your music library</h4>
                    <p>Similar to your inventory tracking system, you'll want to keep a record of your music library. Title, Composer, Arranger, 
                        Grade level, and whatever other information you may find helpful; like genre, instrumentation, or your own comments and notes.

                    <h4>Stock a couple extra strings</h4>
                    <p>Some teachers choose not to do this, but it's definitely easier to get a student back to playing than to wait weeks for them to get 
                        another string to replace the one that broke. Keep some emergency strings on hand--a few per instrument type & size. They don't have
                        to be the best, but they'll keep your classroom rolling. (D'Addario Prelude is my favorite for classroom instruments & budget)

                    <h4>Keep your supplies & accessories organized</h4>
                    <p>Get a Sharpie and write your school name on those rock stops. Same for your spare shoulder rests. If the name isn't on it, they will
                        walk off (even with the name, they still might... kids.) Then have an area where you keep these accessories so the students who borrow
                        them know where to return them.
